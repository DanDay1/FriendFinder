"FoamerFrienz"


FoamerFrienz is a site that helps a foamer (an overly excited railroad enthusiast) find a like-minded friend to go railfanning with. 


This full-stack site pairs users based on a the results of a questionnaire. The ten questions each contain a statement, and the users select a numerical response, with 1 indicating that they "strongly agree" with the statement and 10 indicating that they "strongly disagree." Upon compleation of the questionnaire, the numberical responses are added up and the user is paired with the previous user with the closest sum. 


This application uses the Express, Body-Parser, and Path NPM packages.
